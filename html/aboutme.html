        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p> I live in a family of six. 
            I am the oldest of the four children, I have two younger sisters and a younger brother. 
            I have over 30 cousins on my moms side, and four on my dads side. 
            But overall I have a huge family on both sides. 
            And there spread all throughout the country and world.
            We have no pets due to allergies from me and one of my younger sisters. 
            We have a trucking company thats been in the family for five generations. 
        </p>
        <h3>Interest</h3>
        <p>
            I have a lot of interests, obviously technology is one of them If I've made this website. 
            But my interest in tech has grown over the past 5 years or so, and that interest has resulted in me joining a robotics class and taking a Computer Software Development Course at Indian Hills. 
            Another one of my interests is cars, mainly GM's vehicles, but I know just a little of everything in America's most popular car brands. 
            I also have an interest in Lego's, right now I have 31 lego's which is 19,897 pieces, below is a table of all of my current lego's, two of those are technic lego's, one is an icon, one was custom built by me (No Instructions, Pure Imagination), and the others are all Star Wars. 
            Which brings up my final interest, Star Wars, every since my mom introduced me to Star Wars I've always been hooked, I've watched all the movies, most of the shows, and watch videos about the franchise, you could ask me anything and I'd probably have an answer for you.

        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>
            I am a junior this year at Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont Jr/Sr Highschool. I'm also a college student at Indian Hills Community College. 
            Last year was my first year in robotics, we didn't go to competition but it helped me gain the nessecary experience for this year, and resulted in me becoming the Team Leader for the rest of my years in robotics.
            As for the college course, this is my first year in this course, I decided to do it because its free, it will help with robotics, and will help my job in the future.
            After I graduate, I plan on going to Indian Hills, to get my Gen Eds over with since I get a $1000 scholarship if I pass one of there classes. 
            Then I plan on going to Iowa State University to study Computer Engineering, or something similiar to that if I change my mind, either way it will deal with tech and computers.
