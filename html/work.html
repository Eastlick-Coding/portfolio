        <p> I currently work three jobs. 
            All three jobs fall under the landscaping category, one is strictly mowing, the second is mowing and gardening, and finally the last one is just to help to do whatever projects or the tasks the owner has me do. 
            I'm hoping to get one more job, and that would preferably be with a store of some sort, just so I could always have work if the other three places didn't have any work for me and to get a steady paycheck. 
            In the future I would like my job to be either a Computer Hardware Engineer or a Software Developer. If I was to be a Computer Hardware Enginner I would like to design the chips for computer or other related electronics, or if I wanted to be a Software Developer, because I have coding experience from my robotics class and my Computer Software Development college class. I would prefer to work at Apple for both of my jobs and OpenAI for the Software Developer. The reason why I chose these jobs is cause I love technology, it is very interesting, plus the pay would be good for both of those jobs!
